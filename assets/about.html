                <p>Hi! I'm Max and I'm the founder of BitWeb Solutions.

                    no matter what you need, you're in good hands.

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Since the start of 2020, like many others I've been working from home. I've been lucky to work in the tech industry for a
                        long time so the working from home adjustment didn't take long for me.
                        <br>
                        I used the additional time I was not spending travelling to work to build my skills in all areas as it has always been my
                        ambition to start a business of my own.
                        <br><br>
                        My first IT job was in the NHS where I was part of a technical helpdesk. Taking calls from healthcare staff to help resolve their technical
                        issues is where my passion for IT started. From there I entered a new role in the "deployment" team where we carried out 
                        installations of IT equipment across the county. 
                        <br>
                        After the NHS was a big jump for me as I started working for Dyson in the Malmesbury office. This was very different from the 
                        environment I was used to and unfortunately due to large scale staff redundancy my journey there didn't last long.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2019 I started working for a local company called Cristie Data. Cristie is what taught me most of the networking and 
                        infrastructure knowledge I know today. I was exposed to all elements of IT infrastructure like networking, firewalls, storage 
                        and cloud data.
                        <br>
                        2021 came along and I made a move back to healthcare, I started working for a company called Healios. Everything I saw in Healios 
                        is wildly different to everything I had experienced previously. Healios is completely remote, hardly anyone works from an office 
                        and everything is run from the cloud which is so refreshing to see.
                        While working for Healios I was able to build on my web development skills and learn so many new things that have helped me get to where I am today.
